## Welcome to SC2Aiur's general guide to playing Protoss

### For specific matchup help, head over to [PvT](/pvt/), [PvP](/pvp/) or [PvZ](/pvz/)

You are new to Starcraft II or Protoss? This is the perfect place to start! Keep in mind that each race is different and plays differently, and for protoss specifically, each matchup must be thought of individually, with something as simple as placing your first pylon having severe repercussions.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Starcraft II, and understand how each unit functions. If you do not, we recommend you start by playing the campaign, an excellent and very fun starter! From there, you can just jump in on ladder and have fun playing against others. After 20 games or so you, should be playing against people of your skill level, where you should win 50% of your games.

From there, you may want to start improving. It is generally agreed upon that the best way to improve is to learn how to macro. What is macro? You can find a very detailed explanation on Terrancraft [here](https://terrancraft.com/2017/05/18/es-mechanics-basics-and-macro/). Basically, it is the actions taken to build an army as big and as quickly as possible, because in Starcraft, a bigger army almost always wins versus a smaller army. How do you macro? The first step is to constantly be building probes, never letting your nexuses go idle until you have a desired count (60-80 probes). Build pylons as to never get supply blocked. With what is left, you build buildings and units.

The best way to approach this is by having a build order, and following as closely as possible.
